{"name":"Full-width Underscores","tagline":"A Full-width HTML Structure for the Underscores Starter Theme by Automattic","body":"_An explanation of the minimal HTML changes and CSS additions have been described below and in the README.md file. Credit [Automattic](http://automattic.com/) for the starter theme https://github.com/Automattic/_s as well as the README description... minus my additions._\r\n\r\nHi. I'm a starter theme called `Full-width Underscores.` I'm a full-width variation of the `_s` starter theme by Automattic. I'm meant for hacking so don't use me as a Parent Theme. Instead try turning me into the next, most awesome, WordPress theme out there. That's what I'm here for.\r\n\r\nMy ultra-minimal CSS might make me look like theme tartare but that means less stuff to get in your way when you're designing your awesome theme. Here are some of the other more interesting things you'll find here:\r\n\r\n* A just right amount of lean, well-commented, modern, HTML5 templates.\r\n* A helpful 404 template.\r\n* A sample custom header implementation in `inc/custom-header.php` that can be activated by uncommenting one line in functions.php and adding the code snippet found the comments of `inc/custom-header.php` to your `header.php` template.\r\n* Custom template tags in `inc/template-tags.php` that keep your templates clean and neat and prevent code duplication.\r\n* Some small tweaks in `inc/extras.php` that can improve your theming experience.\r\n* Keyboard navigation for image attachment templates. The script can be found in `js/keyboard-navigation.js`. It's enqueued in `functions.php`.\r\n* A script at `js/small-menu.js` that makes your menu a toggled dropdown on small screens (like your phone), ready for CSS artistry. It's enqueued in `functions.php`.\r\n* 2 sample CSS layouts in `layouts` for a sidebar on either side of your content.\r\n* Smartly organized starter CSS in `style.css` that will help you to quickly get your design off the ground.\r\n* Licensed under GPLv2 or later. :) Use it to make something cool.\r\n\r\nWhat is Full-width Underscores?\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nFull-width Underscores is almost exactly the same as the original `_s` starter theme by the Automattic team. You can find it here: https://github.com/Automattic/_s/\r\n\r\nUsing their awesome tool at http://underscores.me/, I created this variation of the theme using the theme slug `fwu` to replace `_s` throughout the theme.\r\n\r\nI created this variation because the original Underscores was set up to have a page-width HTML structure. That means directly inside of the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> tag for the theme, a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> was placed acting as a container for all other site content. While there's nothing wrong with that, many web designers like to create full-width designs that allow design elements to span the entire width of the viewport while keeping the content within a given \"page\" range.\r\n\r\nWith a traditional page-width structure, styling the site <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> is the only way to design for full-width. The problem with that is you lose the ability to design the full-width area \"behind\" individual HTML elements like the <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code>. Sure, a little design trickery on the <body> will achieve the same visual results but it's a pretty silly approach.\r\n\r\nFull-wdith Underscores addresses this issue by removing the original \"container\" <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> (#page) from the HTML structure and wrapping each of its former first-child elements in their own containers.\r\n\r\n\t<div id=\"header-row\" class=\"full\">\r\n\t\t<div class=\"main\">\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t... <header> Header, for example </header> ...\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t</div>\r\n\r\nThe corresponding CSS is as follows:\r\n\r\n\t.full { width: 100% }\r\n\t.main { width: 1024px; margin: 0 auto; }\r\n\r\nWith this HTML and CSS in place, .full elements will span the entire viewport and can be style on their own. Their first-child .main is given a defined width (which can easily be changed) but also centered in the viewport with the margin property. \r\n\r\nThis provides a full-width HTML structure great for design flexibility but also allows the site content to remain within a given range on the screen. A page-width look can even be achieved by styling .main the way you would have originally styled the \"container\" <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> (#page).\r\n\r\nI've also added an \"inner\" class to the <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, the main content <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> (.site-content), and the <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code>. This class isn't necessary but comes in handy for styling the important elements inside of the full-width structure all at once. For example, they've been given the following CSS:\r\n\r\n\t.inner { padding: 1em 0; }\r\n\r\n\r\nThis creates a little separation between the edges of the full-width borders and the content they contain.\r\n\r\nGetting Started\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nFull-width Underscores' one drawback is that the awesome underscores.me can't be used since I've already used it to create this theme. However, you still have the option to roll with FWU's setup or you can mannually replace the theme slug with the same methods used in the original Underscores.\r\n\r\nDownload `Full-width Underscores` from github. The first thing you want to do is copy the `full-width_s-master` directory and change the name of the theme to something else - Like, say, `megatherium` - then you'll need to do a five-step find and replace on the name in all the templates.\r\n\r\n1. Search for `'fwu'` (inside single quotations) to capture the text domain.\r\n2. Search for `fwu_` to capture all the function names.\r\n3. Search for <code>&nbsp;fwu</code> (with a space before it) to capture DocBlocks.\r\n4. Search for `fwu-` to capture prefixed handles.\r\n5. Search for `Text Domain: fwu` in style.css.\r\n\r\nOR\r\n\r\n* Search for: `'fwu'` and replace with: `'megatherium'`\r\n* Search for: `fwu_` and replace with: `megatherium_`\r\n* Search for: <code>&nbsp;fwu</code> and replace with: <code>&nbsp;Megatherium</code>\r\n* Search for: `fwu-` and replace with: `megatherium-`\r\n* Search for: `Text Domain: fwu` and replace with: `Text Domain: megatherium` in style.css.\r\n\r\nThen, update the stylesheet header in style.css and the links in footer.php with your own information. Next, update or delete this readme. Also, understand that no functionality has been removed in this variation of Underscores. Everything still works as the Automattic team intended.\r\n\r\nNow you're ready to go! The next step is easy to say but harder to do: make an awesome WordPress theme. :)\r\n\r\nGood luck!","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
